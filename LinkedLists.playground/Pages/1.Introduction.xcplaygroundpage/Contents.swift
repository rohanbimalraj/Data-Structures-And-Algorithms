 # Introduction
 A linked list is a linear collection of data elements sequentially linked together by a series of nodes. The firs node in the list, called The Head, is where we add things to the beginning of our list. The last node in the list, the tale, points off into the ether.
 
 - Super fast delete/insert at front O(1)
 - No need to define size upfront, can grow and shrink dynamically
 - No random access like array O(n)
