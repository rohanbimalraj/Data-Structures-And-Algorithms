 # Introduction
 An array is a collection of elements all of same type that can be set and retrived via continous series of integers or what are more commonly called indices. These indices or indexes which in most computer languages starts with 0 determines where in the array things happen.
 
 ## Things to know:
 - Arrays can hold anything
 - Arrays are of fixed size
 - Random Access O(1)
 - get: O(1)
 
 ## Mechanics:
 - Get: O(1)
 - Insert: O(n)
 - Delete: O(n)
 - How the array grow: When a new element is added to an array that has reached its maximum capacity, a new array is created with double the size of the original. The existing elements are copied into the new array, and then the new element is inserted.
